[Passanger]
Its an Apache module that lets you host ruby applications on Apache server.

INSTALL
sudo gem install passenger

Once downloaded you need to install the module using the following command.
sudo passenger-install-apache2-module

	This will kick of the installer for the module..



	--------------------------------------------
	The Apache 2 module was successfully installed.

	Please edit your Apache configuration file, and add these lines:

	   LoadModule passenger_module /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-3.0.9/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
	   PassengerRoot /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-3.0.9
	   PassengerRuby /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby

	After you restart Apache, you are ready to deploy any number of Ruby on Rails
	applications on Apache, without any further Ruby on Rails-specific
	configuration!

	Press ENTER to continue.


	--------------------------------------------
	Deploying a Ruby on Rails application: an example

	Suppose you have a Rails application in /somewhere. Add a virtual host to your
	Apache configuration file and set its DocumentRoot to /somewhere/public:

		   <VirtualHost *:80>
	      ServerName www.yourhost.com
	      DocumentRoot /somewhere/public    # <-- be sure to point to 'public'!
	      <Directory /somewhere/public>
	         AllowOverride all              # <-- relax Apache security settings
	         Options -MultiViews            # <-- MultiViews must be turned off
	      </Directory>
	   </VirtualHost>

	And that's it! You may also want to check the Users Guide for security and
	optimization tips, troubleshooting and other useful information:
